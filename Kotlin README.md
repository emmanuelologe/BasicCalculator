# Overview

As a software engineer, I strive to expand my knowledge and expertise in various programming languages. This project demonstrates the creation of a basic calculator application in Kotlin, showcasing the language's features and syntax.

I developed this software to solidify my understanding of Kotlin's capabilities, including handling arithmetic operations, user input, and control structures. The project serves as a practical example of Kotlin's expressive and concise syntax, as well as its support for object-oriented programming.

# Development Environment

I used IntelliJ IDEA as the integrated development environment (IDE) to develop this software. IntelliJ IDEA provides robust support for Kotlin and includes tools for debugging, testing, and building applications.

The programming language used is Kotlin, a modern language that is fully interoperable with Java. No additional libraries were necessary for this basic application.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}

* Implement more advanced mathematical operations (e.g., exponentiation, square roots).
* Add a graphical user interface (GUI) to enhance user interaction.
* Include input validation to handle incorrect or unexpected inputs more gracefully.
* Allow for chaining multiple operations in a single input.
* Integrate a history feature to track previous calculations.
